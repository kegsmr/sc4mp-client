## Development Guidelines

To maintain consistency and compatibility across the project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Python Version  
Use **Python 3.8** for all development work. This version is the latest release of Python that is compatible with Windows Vista, 7, and 8. Using a newer version would break this compatibility and could prevent the project from running on these operating systems. You can download **Python 3.8** here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/)

### 2. External Modules  
External modules **may only be used** if they are:  
- **Already included in the project**; or  
- **Explicitly approved by the maintainers** prior to use.  

The use of external modules is discouraged for core functionalities essential to the project. If you choose to use external modules, ensure that the program remains functional even if the module is not installed.

**Example:** The module `PIL` is used in the client for rendering the server loading backgrounds (a non-essential functionality). If `PIL` is not available, server loading backgrounds are simply not rendered. Here's what this looks like in practice:

```python
try:
    from PIL import Image, ImageTk, UnidentifiedImageError
    sc4mp_has_pil = True
except ImportError:
    sc4mp_has_pil = False
```

The `LoadingBackgroundUI` then checks if the module is available and handles its absence gracefully.

### 3. Code Style  
Follow standard Python conventions as defined in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Make sure your code is clean, readable, and well-commented where necessary.

### 4. Testing  
Ensure your changes are tested thoroughly before submitting a pull request. This helps maintain the stability and reliability of the project.
